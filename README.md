# Thoth
![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/smite_gamepedia/images/1/19/SkinArt_Thoth_Default.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20161103061230) 

This repo is essentially my own quizlet. I'm confident the program I would create would do more for my long-term knowledge spacing and memory retention than Quizlet ever could - especially since all their nice features are paid now.

# Installation

> Preface: I'm a gigachad Windows user. This entire application (at this time...) is built from that context. If you're not on Windows, this won't work for you.

> Preface #2: Additionally, I have developed this Python script on Windows 11. I have not tested this script or this repo at large on any other version of Windows. Be advised.

First thing you have to do is to install Python of course. This program was built on Python 3.11. For the best results, use this version of Python... or else. üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è

### Essentials

Start your Python journey [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). I recommend using an installer in most cases.

Add Python to your ENVIRONMENT variables, PATH and all that jazz. Plenty of Python installation tutorials out there - find one if you need.

Assuming Python has been installed correctly, now it's time to install our prerequisite Python modules. In any terminal application, run the following commands:

`pip install pytz`

(Just one... for now üòé)

Now the Python script is fully operational. Simply navigate to your local directory, and run the script with: `python Thoth.py`

### Optional: Windows Start-Up Functionality

Assuming you want to have the Thoth script run automatically upon Windows start-up, follow these instructions. 

First step is to Install Windows Terminal application. You can do so here from the [Microstore Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N0DX20HK701?ocid=pdpshare). Once installed, verify that there is a WT Profile called "Command Prompt" in the application. Create one if it isn't there. The batch script will not work otherwise.

Next step it to make a shortcut of the thoth_startup.bat file. Once the shortcut has been made, do the following:

1. Press Win + R.
2. Type `shell:startup` into the Run prompt.
3. Press Enter.
4. This should bring you to a folder for which the absolute path is the following:

        C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup

5. Drag that .bat shortcut you had made into the Startup folder.

And there we go. You are officially done setting up the Windows Start-Up Functionality. Anytime you log-in to your computer, the Thoth script will automatically run and open for you to hop right into a review session.

# Future Forward

I have some ideas for future features, all with varying priorities. Here are some of them.

### High Priority

1. **GUI Implementation**
   1. Frankly, the program lacks power due to its struggle with image representation capability. A lack of imaging restricts the power and efficacy of a lot of the review questions that I can ask. Only so many complex and efficacious questions you can ask when you can't include graphics in the question.
 
2. **Data Visualizations**
   1. Let's put those data logs and all the potential analytics to good use! : D

3. **Review Session Options**
   1. I want to allow users to mix up how they run their review sessions. Maybe they randomize them, tackle the hardest questions, the questions they miss most often, etc.

### Medium Priority

1. **Utilizing a Database**
   1. I'd prefer not to utilize a series of JSON files to execute the business logic of this application. At some point, I want to convert over to proper databases.

2. **Data Encyption / Security**
   1. I know that I don't care about exposing my personal performance data for these review sessions. I recognize not everyone feels the same way, and I see the need to move towards securing the data generated by the program. It's just... not a HUGE priority for me at this time.

3.  **Web Functionality**

### Low Priority

1. Time Zone Auto-Detection
   1. Ideally, it'd be nice for the program to automatically detect the user's timezone based on their operating system / clock. This way, the user no longer needs to be prompted to provide their time zone.
   
2. User Accounts
   1.  Allows an identity to be tied to the data logs that get generated from the program. Nice feature, it just sits outside the scope of why I built this program.
   
3.  Multi-platform Support
